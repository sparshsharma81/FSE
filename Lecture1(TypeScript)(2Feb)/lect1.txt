function isAllowedToVote(age){
    if(age< 18)return false;
    return true;

}

let res = isAllowedToVote();

consolve.log(result);


//the code should output error--- but it output true as the age is undefined


//this means that the user is allowed to vote and his age is above 18
//so it is the error in our code 


//when we define a parameter in javascript and when we not define the value
//then the value is passed as undefined 


variable is declared but the value is not assigned



npx tsc -- init

nodejs will ignore all types of error..so despite of the error..the code runs


WHAT is the difference between type and interface
